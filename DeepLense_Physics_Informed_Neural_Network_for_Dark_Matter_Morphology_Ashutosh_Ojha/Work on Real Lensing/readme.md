# Files Overview

Here's an overview of the Python notebooks in this repository:

* **`generate-paired.ipynb`**
    * **Purpose:** Generates a paired dataset of lensed and source images.

* **`analysis-paired.ipynb`**
    * **Purpose:** Analyzes how different lensing profiles impact image generation.

* **`contrastive-pretraining.ipynb`**
    * **Purpose:** Implements SimCLR-based contrastive pretraining.

* **`smooth_image_comparison.ipynb`**
    * **Purpose:** Compares smooth images (lacking substructure) with those generated by other model profiles.
    * **Details:** This comparison is crucial for understanding whether key features of a source image survive the lensing operation or are lost due to noise or excessive smoothing.

* **`LLMT Classifier.ipynb`**
    * **Purpose:** Compares the performance of the LLMT Classifier and ResNet18, where the LLMT Classifier outperforms ResNet18 while having only a fraction of its parameters.
